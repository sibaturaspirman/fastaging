	<h2 class="c-headingLv2">Part 4: Engineer Interview ― Participating was the Best Decision of my College Life</h2>
	<p class="c-text">What are the students who got jobs at Mitsubishi Electric Automation (China) after participating in MECA doing now? What did taking part in MECA mean to them? Before the finals, we spoke to Qin, who has been working as an FA systems engineer at Mitsubishi Electric Automation (China) in Shanghai.</p>

 <p class="c-img__caption">Profile: Qin Feng Chao<br>Participated in the 14th MECA when he was a student at Ren’ai College, Tianjin University. Graduated in 2023 and got a job at Mitsubishi Electric Automation (China).</p>
<p class="c-question">──How did you find out about MECA?</p>
<p class="c-text">My university was a school that focuses on electrical engineering, especially power electronics, and so there is a lot of interest in this competition. Every year, the laboratory encourages students to take part in MECA.</p>
 <div class="l-grid">
			<div class="l-grid__item l-grid__item-6">
			<p class="c-question">──Why did you join MECA?</p>
			<p class="c-text">Firstly, MECA is a very prestigious national event with a huge impact. The contest has been running continuously since 2007, so the governing body and selection process is very well established, which was another reason to participate.</p>

			</div><!-- /.l-grid__item -->
 	</div><!-- /.l-grid -->
 	<p class="c-question">──What specific products did you make in the contest?</p>
	<p class="c-text">My team created a rotating shoe cabinet as a piece of IoT (internet of things) furniture. The main point was to make it possible for users to operate the PLC from their smartphones. As well as the mechanical design, we also had to think about the product aesthetics as a key element, since the product was aimed at the consumer market.</p>
	<p class="c-question">──Did you have to study on your own to get up to speed with the topics given in the contest?</p>
	<p class="c-text">We had to use Mitsubishi Electric products in the contest. But these are not the only products we learn about at college. When I took part in the contest, I was still in my second year and I hadn’t yet taken any PLC classes, so I had to learn about the products used in the contest by myself. But I was able to broaden my perspective on engineering through this self-study.</p>
	<p class="c-question">──What year are most of the participants in at college? </p>
	<p class="c-text">I think they are mainly second and third-year students. First-year students are learning about the basics in their specialist subject, and fourth-year students are using their time to prepare for future career paths (jobs, internships, higher education, etc.), so there are fewer students participating from these year groups.</p>
	<p class="c-question">──What are the benefits of participating in MECA and reaching the finals for students?</p>
	<div class="l-grid">
			<div class="l-grid__item l-grid__item-6">
			<p class="c-text">Participating in MECA was one of the best decisions I made in my university career. Personally, taking part in the competition with my teammates has improved my ability to learn independently and build solid friendships. I also gained a great sense of personal achievement as I competed against some outstanding university students and still achieved good results.</p>

 	<p class="c-question">──Why did you choose Mitsubishi Electric as your place of employment?</p>
	<p class="c-text">Mitsubishi Electric is one of the world's leading manufacturers in industrial automation solutions. Working for them means I am able to gain resources, platforms and benefits that are difficult for other companies to offer. I had also found that the company emphasizes the overall development of its employees, including not only technical skills but also soft skills such as public speaking.</p>
	<p class="c-text">Another reason why I decided to join the company was that, unlike the 996* and 007* work systems that we often hear about these days, there was not much overtime and a guaranteed two days off every week.</p>
	<p class="c-note c-text">* 996 refers to a workday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week, while 007 refers to being available 24 hours a day seven days a week. Such long hours work culture has become a social problem in China. </p>
	<p class="c-question">──As an engineer and trainee who joined Mitsubishi Electric, what are your dreams for the future? </p>
	<p class="c-text">Since I’m still in my six-month on-the-job training period, I don't have any specific dreams yet. My seniors are extremely good at what they do, so I would like to use this time to improve my skills as quickly as possible so that I can do a good job as a factory automation engineer.</p>
	<p class="c-question">──As a seasoned participant, what is your message to others thinking of taking part in MECA? </p>
	<p class="c-text">First of all, I want to thank everyone who applied. It relies on the students for MECA to continue developing. Second, participating in MECA is sure to be an invaluable experience in your university life, which will definitely help you in your career or further education. Finally, I would like to pay tribute to all the participants, for all the hard work they have put in over the months. Good luck and I wish you all the best in the future!</p>
