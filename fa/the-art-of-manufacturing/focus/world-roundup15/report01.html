	<p class="c-text u-fw--bold u-fz--20 u-fz--18-sm">In December 2022, the inaugural “Mitsubishi Electric FA Golf Open” took place in Suzhou, Taihu Lake Resort, an international golfing center little over 100km West from Shanghai, China. This was the fourth of seven golf tourneys that comprised the 2022 China Tour organized by the China Golf Association. The men's event attracted many of the top Chinese professional golf players who competed not only for the 500,000 yuan (almost $70,000) prize money, but also for opportunities to qualify for the European Tour as well as accruing Official World Golf Ranking points.</p>

		<p class="c-img__caption">The prestigious inaugural tournament was won by the local golf pro Xiao Bowen.</p>
	</div><!-- /.l-grid__item -->
	<div class="l-grid__item l-grid__item-6">
		<p class="c-text u-fw--bold u-fz--20 u-fz--18-sm">After a hard-fought competition, involving 84 competitors, the eventual winner was Xiao Bowen, a seasoned professional who also notably won the 2017 Asian Golf Championship becoming just the third Chinese player to claim that title.</p>

<div class="l-separator-x4 l-separator-x3-sm">
	<p class="c-text">The event not only welcomed professional players for the main tournament, but also amateur players in a mixed pro-am pre-event competition as well. In fact, the amateur performances were worthy of noting in their own right as 17 year old Fang Zegian finished in fifth place, which qualified him to compete in the next stage of the China Tour, the Hainan Open.</p>

	<p class="c-img__caption">This competition demonstrated what sportsmanship has in common with industry: both require professionalism and perseverance to overcome obstacles in harsh conditions.</p>
	<p class="c-text">One other very important amateur player to note, at least from Mitsubishi Electric's perspective, was our very own Akinori Itodani, an employee of Mitsubishi Electric Automation (China) Ltd., who started to play golf at the age of 30. Itodani says he felt very honored to represent the company at a professional golf tournament but was under a lot of pressure.</p>
	<div class="l-grid">
		<div class="l-grid__item l-grid__item-6">
			<p class="c-text">“I am thrilled to have the opportunity to participate in a competition like this, competing on the same course with so many professional golfers and having the chance to meet them,” says Itodani.</p>

	<p class="c-text">While being the first golf sponsorship in China for Mitsubishi Electric Automation (China) Ltd., it is not the first for the Mitsubishi Electric Group. In the United States, Mitsubishi Electric sponsors both the Mitsubishi Electric Championship at Hualalai in Hawaii, and the Mitsubishi Electric Classic held in the greater Atlanta area of Georgia. Both events are part of the PGA Tour Champions program. In Japan, the company sponsors the “Mitsubishi Electric Ladies Golf Hisako Higuchi”, a part of Japan’s LPGA Tour.</p>
	<p class="c-text">Mitsubishi Electric believes that international sports are a great way to promote culture, understanding and sportsmanship which all aid building bridges between people and nations. This kind of activity really illustrates the company’s commitment, "Changes for the Better", through the use of practical activities and experiences.</p>
	<p class="c-text">Going forward, Mitsubishi Electric Automation (China) Ltd. will in addition to providing automation products and services, continue to support sporting events and local projects, helping to create a happier, healthier, and more sustainable future.</p>
	<p class="c-text">Mitsubishi Electric Automation (China) Ltd. hopes to see you at the 2023 “Mitsubishi Electric FA Golf Open" which will again be at Suzhou at around October time.</p>
