(Can be combined with an Adapter Board) \n\nA maximum of 1 Communication Expansion Board and 1 Analog Adapter Board, or 1 Analog Expansion board and 1 Communication Adapter Board can be connected together. \n\n■ Adapter Board (Analog, Communication) \nFrom the Base Unit a special system order can be connected. Connection link is built-in.\n \nA maximum of 1 Communication Adapter Board or Expansion Board and 1 Analog Adapter Board or Expansion Board can be connected together.  \n*It is not necessary to connect the FX3G-CNV-AD to the base unit. \n*The I/O points are not occupied.\n\n■ Power Supply Extension Unit (FX3U-1PSU-5V) \nAC type power supply to be added when more capacity than the base unit power supply can provide. \nSupplies power to Input and Output Extension Blocks. \nHowever, when using Input Extension Block (FX2N-8ER-ES/UL, FX2N-8ER) please use the base unit type mentioned above or a DC24V service power supply of an I/O Extension Unit\n*A maximum of 1 unit can be connected a 1 system. \n\n■ Extension Bus Cable\nCable for connecting to Extension Units. \nWhen using an Extension Block or Special Function Module, the FX2N-CNV-BC Interface Adapter is necessary. \n*Only 1 Extension Bus Cable can be used per system. \n\n■ Interface Adapter (FX2N-CNV-BC) \nWhen using the Extension Bus Cable with an Extension Block or adding a Special Function Module, connects the Extension Bus Cable with the standard cable.\n\n\n■ Memory cassette\nWhen the memory cassette is installed, it assumes priority and works as a substitute for the base unit internal EEPROM. \n*1 unit can be added. \n\n■ Display module (FX3G-5DM) \nA simple display module that can be attached to the main body of the base unit. \n*1 unit can be added.","DATA_TYPE":9,"SORT_ORDER":11},{"SERIES_NM":"FX3GA-A","HINT":"","DATA_TYPE":9,"SORT_ORDER":12},{"SERIES_NM":"FX3GA-B","HINT":"","DATA_TYPE":9,"SORT_ORDER":13}]
