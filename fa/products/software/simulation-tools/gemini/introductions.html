                <p>We wanted to increase the number of work stations from the current five to six and achieve a cycle time of 103 minutes/unit. <br>
				However, it was difficult to conduct preliminary verification, including detailed loss analysis, and using conventional Excel<sup>&reg;</sup>-based calculations.</p>

              <div>
                <h6>Preparation</h6>
                <p>MELSOFT Gemini was used to reproduce the current line based on line specifications (station layout, individual work time, etc.)<br>
				Current model construction was completed in around two days due to the abundance of 3D models already set up in the eCatalog.</p>

                <h6>Verification</h6>
                <p>Cycle time was reduced to 99 min/unit with one additional work station and one additional operator.<br>
				A graph function detected idling losses that were previously unnoticeable, and the installation of an intermediate work station eliminated these losses.<br>
				In actual operation, cycle time was reduced to 92 min/unit, thus increasing production capacity.</p>

                <p>Based on the simulation results of MELSOFT Gemini, the target production volume of 80 unites/month was achieved.<br>
				In addition, idling loss was eliminated by installing an intermediate work-in-process stand which saved approx. JPY600,000 annually. <br>
				Due to the high accuracy of the preliminary verification, rework was reduced by redesign and additional work.</p>
